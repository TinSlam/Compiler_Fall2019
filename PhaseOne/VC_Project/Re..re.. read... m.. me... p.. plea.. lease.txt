Simply run the corresponding ".bat" file to generate a VS project.

Note that everytime a change is made to the Lex or Yacc files, the
project needs to be REBUILT in order to have the changes be applied.

Most often a manual rebuild (Not even a normal build) needs to be
initiated since VS doesn't detect a change in the project's ".cpp"
files.
